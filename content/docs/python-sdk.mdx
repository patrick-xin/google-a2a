## Installation

You can install the A2A SDK using either `uv` or `pip`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `uv` (optional, but recommended) or `pip`

### Using `uv`

When you're working within a uv project or a virtual environment managed by uv, the preferred way to add packages is using uv add.

```bash
uv add a2a-sdk
```

### Using `pip`

If you prefer to use pip, the standard Python package installer, you can install `a2a-sdk` as follows

```bash
pip install a2a-sdk
```
