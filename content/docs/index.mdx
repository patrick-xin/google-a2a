## Unlock Collaborative Agent Scenarios

The **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol** is an open standard designed to enable seamless communication and collaboration between AI agents. In a world where agents are built using diverse frameworks and by different vendors, A2A provides a common language, breaking down silos and fostering interoperability.

### Why A2A Matters

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
<Card title="Interoperability">
 Connect agents built on different platforms (LangGraph, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel, custom solutions) to create powerful, composite AI systems.
</Card>

<Card title="Complex Workflows">
Enable agents to delegate sub-tasks, exchange information, and coordinate actions to solve complex problems that a single agent cannot.
</Card>

<Card title="Secure & Opaque">
Agents interact without needing to share internal memory, tools, or proprietary logic, ensuring security and preserving intellectual property.

### A2A and MCP: Complementary Protocols

![A2A and MCP](https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/assets/a2a-mcp-readme.png)


A2A and the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) are complementary standards for building robust agentic applications:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Connects agents to **tools, APIs, and resources** with structured inputs/outputs. Think of it as the way agents access their capabilities.
- **A2A (Agent2Agent Protocol):** Facilitates **dynamic, multimodal communication between different agents** as peers. It's how agents collaborate, delegate, and manage shared tasks.
